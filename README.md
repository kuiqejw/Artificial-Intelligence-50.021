# Artificial-Intelligence-50.021
The lazy B-grade guide to SUTD's AI subject. 
* Yeah, I did get a B here. 
* Credit the notes to [@Shaun2h/Shaun Toh](https://github.com/shaun2h ). He saved my ass during AI for studying. As always, it's named "Insufficient"
* My own notes are horrible. They're handwritten. 
* Same as DL, First half of Binder's notes are terrible. Refer to DL for his term. I'm just going to upload what I have, regardless if they make sense or not. 
* Another guide I'll recommend (if you didn't pop in by googling SUTD AI) is [@zhexxian| SUTD SENIOR] She has better HW, but I have the newest version of AI as the time I write this README. 
* Datasets are too huge to upload here.
